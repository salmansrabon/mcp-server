    "AIinsight": "The root cause of the issue is that the offset value in the SQL query is negative. In the SQL query, the `LIMIT` clause is used to limit the number of rows returned by the query. The syntax is `LIMIT offset, count`, where `offset` is the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows, and `count` is the maximum number of rows to return. A negative offset is not allowed and will result in a syntax error.\n\nThe error log shows the following SQL query: `SELECT id, name, email, password, phone_number, nid, role, photo, createdAt, updatedAt FROM Users AS Users LIMIT 0, -5;`. The `-5` is the offset value, which is causing the issue.\n\nThe error is likely happening in the `listUsers` function in the `user.controller.js` file. This function uses the `offset` query parameter to set the offset in the SQL query. If the `offset` query parameter is not provided, it defaults to `0`. However, if a negative number is provided, it will cause a syntax error in the SQL query.\n\nHere is a potential fix:\n\n- In the `listUsers` function, add a check to ensure that the `offset` query parameter is not negative.

The error log states \"Login failed\" and the stack trace shows a Promise object, which suggests an asynchronous operation (possibly a database query or a JWT verification) failed.\n\nThe commit diff shows that the logging feature in Sequelize was enabled, but it doesn't seem to directly relate to the login issue. However, the vector-based code match points to the `authenticateJWT` middleware function in `jwtMiddleware.js`. This function checks if the request header contains a valid JWT token. If the token is invalid or expired, it returns a 403 status code with a message \"Token invalid!\" or \"Token expired!\".\n\nThe matched code snippet from `user.controller.js` shows that the JWT token is signed with an environment variable `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`. If this environment variable is not correctly set in the server's environment, the JWT token would be invalid and cause the login to fail.\n\nTo fix the issue:\n\n- Ensure that the `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable is correctly set in the server's environment.\n- If the JWT token is expired, the user should be prompted to login again to get a new token.\n- If the JWT token is invalid for other reasons, check the token generation logic in `user.controller.js` to ensure it's correctly implemented."

Default: console.log\n(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)",
    "AIinsight": "The root cause of the issue is the change in the Sequelize configuration in the `db.js` file. The commit diff shows that the logging option was changed from `false` to `true`. However, the error log indicates that the logging option should be either a function or `false`. This is causing a DeprecationWarning to be thrown.\n\nTo fix this issue, the logging option should be reverted back to `false` or replaced with a function that handles logging. Here's how you can do this:\n\n- Open the `db.js` file in the `sequelizeModel` directory.\n- Locate the Sequelize configuration.\n- Change the logging option back to `false` or replace it with a function.\n\nHere's an example of what the corrected code might look like:\n\n```javascript\nconst sequelize = new Sequelize(db_name, db_user, password, {\n    host: host,\n    dialect: 'mysql',\n    logging: false\n});\n```\n\nOr, if you want to replace it with a function:\n\n```javascript\nconst sequelize = new Sequelize(db_name, db_user, password, {\n    host: host,\n    dialect: 'mysql',\n    logging: msg => console.log(msg)\n});\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, commit and push the updated code to the repository. This should resolve the DeprecationWarning and allow the application to run without this error."

    "AIinsight": "The root cause of the issue seems to be related to the Sequelize logging configuration. The error log shows a DeprecationWarning related to the logging option in Sequelize. The warning suggests that the logging option should be either a function or false. \n\nIn the commit diff, we can see that the logging option was changed from false to true in the Sequelize configuration in the file sequelizeModel/db.js. This change is likely what caused the DeprecationWarning to appear.\n\nRelevant file(s), function(s), and line number(s) from the trace:\n- sequelizeModel/db.js: The Sequelize configuration is set here. The logging option was changed on line 10.\n\nHotfix:\n- Change the logging option back to false in the Sequelize configuration in sequelizeModel/db.js. This should resolve the DeprecationWarning.\n- If logging is needed, a custom function can be provided to the logging option instead of a boolean value. This function will be called with every SQL query that gets executed.\n\nHere is an example of how to set a custom logging function:\n\n```javascript\nconst sequelize = new Sequelize(db_name, db_user, password, {\n    host: host,\n    dialect: 'mysql',\n    logging: msg => console.log(msg)\n});\n```\n\nThis will log all SQL queries to the console. Adjust the function as needed to suit your logging requirements."
